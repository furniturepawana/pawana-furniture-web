PAWANA FURNITURE WEBSITE - CLIENT GUIDE
========================================

Hello! This guide explains your website in simple terms.


WHAT IS YOUR WEBSITE MADE OF?
-----------------------------

Think of your website like a restaurant:

• The WEBSITE CODE is like the recipe book
  → Stored on: GitHub (a safe vault for code)

  Code repo: https://github.com/furniturepawana/pawana-furniture-web.git

• The DATABASE is like your inventory list
  → Stored on: MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)

• The IMAGES are stored separately for fast loading
  → Stored on: Cloudinary (image hosting)

• The WEBSITE ITSELF runs on a server
  → Hosted on: Render (web hosting)

• SPEED BOOST - Frequently accessed data is cached
  → Service: Aiven (Redis caching)

• CONTACT FORMS send emails to you
  → Service: FormSubmit (free email service)

• KEEP-ALIVE - Prevents website from sleeping
  → Service: Cloudflare (pings your site every 14 min)


YOUR ACCOUNT LOGINS
-------------------

You have accounts on these services (save these logins safely):

1. GitHub        - github.com          - Your code storage
2. MongoDB Atlas - cloud.mongodb.com   - Your database
3. Cloudinary    - cloudinary.com      - Your images
4. Render        - render.com          - Your hosting
5. Aiven         - console.aiven.io    - Speed caching
6. Cloudflare    - dash.cloudflare.com - Keep-alive service


WHAT CAN YOU DO YOURSELF?
-------------------------

✓ Add/Edit/Delete products     → Use Admin Panel
✓ Change contact information   → Use Admin Panel
✓ Update homepage content      → Use Admin Panel
             

Your Admin Panel: https://pawanafurniture.com/<your-secret-path>
(Your developer gave you this secret path and login)


WHAT NEEDS A DEVELOPER?
-----------------------

✗ Change website design/layout
✗ Add new features (like payments, accounts)
✗ Fix bugs or errors
✗ Change how things work


HIRING A FUTURE DEVELOPER
-------------------------

When you need a new developer, give them:

1. ACCESS TO CODE
   → Add them to your GitHub repository by making them a collaborator
   → They need this to make any changes

2. THE SECRET FILE (.env)
   → Contains all passwords and connections
   → Your current developer will give you this
   → Share it securely (not via regular email)

3. SERVICE ACCESS
   → Add them to MongoDB, Cloudinary, Render
   → Each service has "Invite User" option
   → Or share login credentials (change password after they're done)

4. TELL THEM TO READ
   → Project-Doc.md in the code
   → It explains everything technical


SECURITY TIPS
-------------

• Change admin password after any developer finishes work
• Keep the .env file secure - never share publicly
• Your GitHub repository should be PRIVATE
• Backup your database periodically (MongoDB does this automatically)


COMMON QUESTIONS
----------------

Q: Website is slow to load sometimes?
A: The free hosting "sleeps" if no one visits for 15 min.
   First visitor wakes it up (takes 10-30 seconds).
   Cloudflare keeps it awake, but may occasionally miss.

Q: Images not showing?
A: Check if the image exists in Cloudinary.
   Make sure the code is copied correctly to Admin Panel.

Q: Can't login to Admin?
A: Clear browser cookies/cache and try again.
   If still failing, check with developer.

Q: Website showing errors?
A: Contact a developer. Don't try to fix code yourself.


COSTS
-----

Current services (all free tiers):
• GitHub         - Free
• MongoDB Atlas  - Free (up to 512MB)
• Cloudinary     - Free (up to 25GB)
• Render         - Free (with sleep after 15min)
• Aiven          - Free trial / Paid after

• MongoDB ($9/month) - More database space
• Cloudinary ($99/month) - More image storage


NEED HELP?
----------

For changes or issues, hire a Node.js developer.
They should have:
• 1-2+ years experience with Node.js
• Experience with MongoDB
• Basic understanding of web development

Your project is built with standard, common technologies.
Any competent web developer can work on it.
