        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p class="about-intro">For over 15 years, we've been transforming wood into legacy pieces that families treasure for generations.</p>
        <p>
          Pawana Furniture is a legacy of craftsmanship, passion, and dedication to creating exquisite furniture pieces that transform houses into homes. Blending traditional woodworking techniques with contemporary aesthetics.
        </p>
        <p>
          What started as a small workshop has grown into one of the most trusted names in premium furniture. Our journey has been guided by a simple philosophy: every piece of furniture should tell a story, reflect personality, and stand the test of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that furniture is more than just functional objects—they are investments in comfort, style, and memories. Each piece that leaves our workshop carries with it the dedication of our master craftsmen and the warmth of our family tradition.
