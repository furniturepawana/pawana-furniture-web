        <p class="about-intro">Resilience, Artistry, and a Vision for Perfection.</p>
        <p>
          The bedrock of Pawana Furniture is the unwavering dedication of its founder, Pawan Dhiman. Inspired by his grandfather’s masterly precision and his father’s tireless industry experience, Pawan honed his skills across Punjab’s leading firms before studying advanced craftsmanship in Italy to secure a unique competitive edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Facing immense financial odds and little support, he launched Pawana Furniture with a bold vision. Despite a brutal initial struggle, his commitment to superior finishing and fair pricing soon captivated clients. Today, Pawana Furniture stands as a triumph of resilience—a brand born from grit and dedicated to the singular goal of transforming our customers' dreams into reality.
